# iOSHolidayApp
The first iOS App I ever made


Developed an application in Xcode during a course at Jönköping University.
The application is similiar to Instagram - create an account, upload images/videos and share them with your friends.
This project just fulfilled the requirements of the course, so the application isn't responsive and the code need refactoring.  

Some features of the app is to load and upload data in form of images and videos through a rest-API, saving data with coredata, location services, Mapkit, in app playable videos etc. The user interface is a mess.   

The app gave atleast highest grade in the course.
