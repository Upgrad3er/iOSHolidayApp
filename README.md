# iOSHolidayApp
The first App I ever made

Developed an application in Xcode during a course at Jönköping University. The application is similar to Instagram - create an account, upload images/videos and share them with your friends. This project just fulfilled the requirements of the course, so the application isn't responsive and the code need refactoring. The course was at least finished with highest grade.

Features:
*Load data from REST-API
*Save data to core data
*location services
*mapkit
*in app playable videos
*browse friends images and videos
*search for friends
*add friends
*etc
