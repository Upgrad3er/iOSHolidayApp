# iOSHolidayApp
The first iOS App I ever made

Developed an application in Xcode during a course at Jönköping University. The application is similar to Instagram - create an account, upload images/videos and share them with your friends. This project just fulfilled the requirements of the course, so the application isn't responsive and the code need refactoring.

Some features of the app is to load and upload data in form of images and videos through a rest-API, saving data with core data, location services, Map kit, in app playable videos, browse friends data, search for friends, add friends etc. The user interface is a mess.

The course was at least finished with highest grade.
