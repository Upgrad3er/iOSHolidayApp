        static var RecentView:[String] = [] // remembers the last viewcontroller so the orientation is corret, this should not work like this becouse a similar function in the viewstack works the sameway but we didnt succeed to make that work. this may be a bad solving.
        static var currentProfile: String? // If its a friendsprofile or the currentusers profile, becouse its the same viewcontroller that shows profiles
        static var currentVacid: String? // Wich vacation that is handled in some scenarios
